1. Strings can be concatenated in C by using the function
strcat(string1,string2).  This function automatically concatenates 
the strings and puts them into string1.
2. If a static array is not initialized, then the array is not given an
automatic size.  In fact, if the function sizeof() is used to locate the
size of the array without first initializing the array, an error will
occur.  
3. A multidimensional array of size 64 can be declared using any dimensions
that when multiplied together equal 64.  For instance, int x[8][8] or 
int x[2][32] or int x[4][16].

a. strcmp() is a function that compares the lexicographical order of two
given strings. It will return either a positive number, zero, or a negative 
number, depending upon whether the first string given comes before, is the
same, or comes after the second given string.  
b. fgets() is a function that is used to input strings.  However, the string
terminator is not added to the string that is given, so the terminator
must be added manually.  The function returns whatever string was given for input.
c. strcat() is a function that concatenates two given strings. This means that the function is used to link characters into an array of characters, or a
string.  It puts the whole new concatenated string into the first string
given.  So, strcat(string1,string2) would concatenate the two strings
together, put this new string into string1, and add the string terminator to
the end of string1.
d. strlen() is a function that is used to find out the length of a given 
string. It disregards the string terminator, so it returns the legitimate 
length of the character array minus one.
